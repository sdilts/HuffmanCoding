#+Title: Plan of Attack
* Purpose
  This document helps to outline the changes needed to the Huffman
  Coding application as specified by the homework assignment into a
  more widely usable program that can save compressed messages to disk.
** Homework Specifications:
   + Only need to encode chars A through Z, plus spaces and
     newlines. All lowercase letters are converted to uppercase
   + No bit manipulation is required. Use Strings to store all binary
     data as explicit 1's and 0's
   + No writing to files is required.
** New Specifications:
   + Encode all ASCII codes 0-127.
   + Save compressed message to disk
   + Read and decode messages that were written to disk by this
     program.
*** Desired Features:
    + Read in all data from file
    + Output final results to file
* Algorithm Steps
  New steps are denoted in *bold* //
  Removed steps are +struck through+ //
** Encoding
   After receiving the message string as a constructor argument:
   1. +Sanitize input+
   1. [@1] Build the frequency table
   2. Build the Huffman Tree
   3. Build the code Table
   4. *Convert code table to canonical form*
   5. Encode Message
** Decoding:
   These steps are based off of the specifications found in
   [[./EncodingFormat.txt]]. Check this file first, as it may be more
   up-to-date with the actual actions of the program.
   1. *Re-create the coding table from the first items in the file*
   2. *Rebuild the Huffman tree using the coding table*
   3. Decode the message with the Huffman tree.
* Homework Specs data types and usage:
  This section explains the variables used in intermediate steps.
** Huffman Code Portion:
   + Uses strings for the message (duh)
   + Freqency table:
     - int array, with location in array denoting character value
   + Huffman tree:
     - Nodes store datatypes as chars
   + codeTable:
     - String array, with location in array denoting character value
   + encodedMesssage:
     - Stored as a string
* File Changes
  This portion contains observations on what may need to be re-written
  and what may be directly ported over from the old specifications
