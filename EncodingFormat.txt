This program compresses text encoded in ASCII format. The EOT code
cannot be used in the file, as it marks the end of encoding.

The compressed binary file created by this program can be decoded with
the following observations:
+ The first byte of the file specifies how many characters, n, are encoded
  into the file.
+ The next n bytes are the ASCII codes of the characters within the
  file. 
+ The next n bytes are the length of each code in the same order as
  the block of byes obtained in the previous step.
+ The rest of the file is the actual contents of the file. The codes
  stop once the EOT char is reached (ASCII code 4).
